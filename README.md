# Surreal Estate Property Search App 

A property listing app built with React.

View available properties and add a new one to see it appear under the listings. You can filter listings by city or search for keywords. You can also sort properties by price, ascending or descending.

Unlock additional features by logging in with Facebook. You can then save properties to your Favourites by clicking the ':purple_heart: Save' button. Navigate to the Favourites tab to view and remove saved properties, and view property details in a pop up by clicking the title.
